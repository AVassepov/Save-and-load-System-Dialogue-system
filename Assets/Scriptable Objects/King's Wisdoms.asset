  - 'Upon his return from the clutches of death , the heavenly king spoke and all
    that could hear him listened. These are the wisdoms that he shared:'
  - 1)Humanity is a gift , and all those without human form lack soul and the true
    gift of life. 2) Therefore all gods without a human form exist to decieve us
    and stray us from achieving a heaven on earth for all people
  - 3) We sould believe , it grants us strength and we strengthen whatever we believe
    in be it people or gods , as such we shant belive in devils and pagan gods. 4)
    Humanity is divided , be it groups, societies or entire countries. They believe
    in what we shall avoid , but we must not judge or persecute them , rather channel
    their faith into our one and only god
  - 5)I am a wise man , but many more like me shall come and spread their wisdom,
    take it to heart and write their wisdoms next to mine 6) I've come back from
    death , but it was meant to be and in it I served humanity. And so shall all
    other belivers die , not in vain but in service for others and for god.
